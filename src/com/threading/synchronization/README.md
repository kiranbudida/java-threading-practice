# Java Synchronization Examples

This folder contains various examples demonstrating different synchronization techniques in Java using threads.

## Contents

### 1. `SynchronizedMethod.java`
Demonstrates how to use the `synchronized` keyword on instance methods to protect shared resources.

### 2. `SynchronizedBlock.java`
Shows how to use synchronized blocks within a method to minimize the synchronized area and improve performance.

### 3. `StaticSynchronization.java`
Illustrates static synchronization using `static synchronized` methods which apply locks at the class level.

### 4. `LockObjectSynchronization.java`
Explains synchronization using a separate `lock` object, which gives more control over locking compared to using `this`.

## How to Run

Compile and run each class independently to understand how thread synchronization works in Java.
